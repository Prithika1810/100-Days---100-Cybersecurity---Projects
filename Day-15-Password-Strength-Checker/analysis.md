# 🔎 Day 15 Analysis — Password Strength Checker

## 1. Purpose
This project demonstrates how to evaluate password strength using:
- Entropy
- Character variety
- Pattern detection
- Length analysis

This is essential for security awareness and Blue Team fundamentals.

---

## 2. What I Did
- Built a Python script that analyzes password strength
- Implemented entropy calculation using log2
- Added checks for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
- Added detection for common weak patterns
- Generated a final strength rating

---

## 3. Why This Matters
Weak passwords are one of the most common causes of:
- Account compromise
- Brute-force attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Unauthorized access

This script teaches how attackers evaluate password strength and how defenders can educate users.

---

## 4. Conclusion
Day‑15 helped me understand:
- How entropy relates to password security
- How to detect weak patterns
- How to build a practical security tool using Python

This is a valuable skill for SOC analysts and cybersecurity engineers.
