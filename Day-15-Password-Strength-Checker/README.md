# 🔐 Day 15 — Password Strength Checker (Python)

## 📌 Overview
Today I built a Python-based **Password Strength Checker** that evaluates how secure a password is based on:
- Length
- Character variety
- Common patterns
- Entropy score

This tool helps identify weak passwords and teaches the fundamentals of secure password creation.

## 🧠 What This Script Checks
- Minimum length requirement  
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols  
- Detection of common weak patterns (e.g., "123", "password", "qwerty")  
- Entropy calculation to estimate password strength  
- Final rating: Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3
- math module
- string module
- Regular expressions (re)
