# 🔐 Day 5 — File Hashing & Malware Detection (Kali Linux)

This project demonstrates a practical cybersecurity workflow for verifying file integrity and detecting potential malware using cryptographic hashing and VirusTotal.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Generate MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes
- Detect file tampering through hash comparison
- Check file reputation using VirusTotal
- Automate hashing with a Bash script
- Document the workflow for cybersecurity portfolios

---

## 🧪 Step 1 — Workspace Setup

```bash
mkdir day5-hashing
cd day5-hashing
echo "This is a test file" > testfile.txt
```

---

## 🔐 Step 2 — Generate Hashes

```bash
md5sum testfile.txt
sha1sum testfile.txt
sha256sum testfile.txt
```

These values act as the file’s cryptographic fingerprints.

---

## 🛡️ Step 3 — Integrity Check

Modify the file:

```bash
echo "new line" >> testfile.txt
```

Re-hash:

```bash
sha256sum testfile.txt
```

Even a single character change produces a completely different hash.

---

## 🧭 Step 4 — Malware Detection (VirusTotal)

1. Copy the SHA256 hash  
2. Visit: https://www.virustotal.com  
3. Paste the hash into the search bar  
4. Review detection results

---

## ⚙️ Step 5 — Automation Script

Create `hashcheck.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "File: $1"
echo "MD5: $(md5sum "$1" | awk '{print $1}')"
echo "SHA1: $(sha1sum "$1" | awk '{print $1}')"
echo "SHA256: $(sha256sum "$1" | awk '{print $1}')"
```

Make executable:

```bash
chmod +x hashcheck.sh
```

Run:

```bash
./hashcheck.sh testfile.txt
```

## 📸 Screenshots
Add the following to the `screenshots/` folder:

- `hash-output.png` — script output  
- `vt-result.png` — VirusTotal result  
- `integrity-change.png` — before/after hash comparison  

---

## ✅ Summary
This workflow demonstrates:
- File integrity monitoring  
- Cryptographic hashing  
- Malware reputation checking  
- Bash automation  
- Real-world defensive security skills  

Perfect for cybersecurity portfolios, apprenticeships, and SOC analyst roles.
