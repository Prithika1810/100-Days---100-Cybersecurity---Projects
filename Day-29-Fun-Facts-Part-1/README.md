# 😂 Day 29 – Cybersecurity Fun Facts

For Day 29 of my 100‑Day Cybersecurity Challenge, I decided to take a fun and relaxed approach by collecting five interesting cybersecurity facts. These are light, surprising, and great for anyone curious about the history and quirks of the cyber world.

### 1️⃣ The first computer virus was created as a joke  
In 1983, a student made the first virus (“Elk Cloner”) just to see if it would spread — and it did.

### 2️⃣ “Password” used to be one of the most common passwords  
For years, millions of people literally used **“password”** as their password.

### 3️⃣ Hackers originally weren’t criminals  
The word “hacker” once described curious problem‑solvers who loved exploring computers.

### 4️⃣ Most cyber attacks start with human mistakes  
Over **90%** of breaches begin with someone clicking a malicious link or falling for phishing.

### 5️⃣ The longest password ever used was over 1,000 characters  
Some systems allow extremely long passphrases — one user famously used a 1,000+ character password.
