# 🔐 Day 25 – Simple Encryption & Decryption Tool (Caesar Cipher)

For Day 25 of my 100‑Day Cybersecurity Challenge, I built a simple Python‑based encryption and decryption tool using a Caesar Cipher. This project focuses on understanding the basics of encryption, key‑based shifting, and secure message handling.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt any message using a numeric key  
- Decrypt encrypted text back to the original  
- Supports letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces  
- Simple menu‑based interface  
- Beginner‑friendly and easy to extend  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each character in the message by a key value.  
Example:  
- Key = 3  
- `A → D`, `B → E`, `C → F`, etc.

Decryption simply reverses the shift.

## 📌 Usage

### **Run the script**
```bash
python3 day25_encryption_tool.py
